# Rule File
We can use this kind of files to create specific wordlists of passwords, usernames, etc. For example if you have to create a password with a capital leter a character and three numbers.

* c -> Capital Letters
* $ -> You decide what character is going to be there example: $1
* Example: c $1 -> Put a wordlist and it passwords will be like: From Banana,Rick to Banana1,Rick1
